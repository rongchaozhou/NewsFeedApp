# NewsFeedApp
This is the 6th project in Android Basics Nanodegree by Google. The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from a certain API related to a particular topic, person, or location. A Settings Screen is required to allow users to narrow down the stories displayed in from the feed.
